        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>In a world where (mis)information surrounds us, it is an understandable to be overwhelmed and stress by the 
            ubiquitous presence of media. It is understandable to be angry at today's headlines, it is understandable to 
            even be willing to destroy them. </p>
        <p>Breaking News was project developed at KISD during the Winter Semester 2018 for the Generative Typo Lab Project. It generates typography
            out of typography itself and uses the people's rage to do so. By breaking characters and rearranging them randomly it distorts the 
            form to fit the distorted message the media displays.
