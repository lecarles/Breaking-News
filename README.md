# Breaking News

In a world where (mis)information surrounds us, it is an understandable to be overwhelmed and stress by the ubiquitous presence of media. It is understandable to be angry at today's headlines, it is understandable to even be willing to destroy them.

Breaking News was project developed at KISD during the Winter Semester 2018 for the Generative Typo Lab Project. It generates typography out of typography itself and uses the people's rage to do so. By breaking characters and rearranging them randomly it distorts the form to fit the distorted message the media displays.
